== Required Environment Variables

Certain environment variables are required in order to run the develop environment and to build the Docker Compose
image.

=== Liberty Development Server

There are several secret values that MUST NOT be stored in version control. Define the following environment variables in your
profile (i.e. `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`, etc.):

* `DATABASE_HOST` - the hostname of the database connection, typically this will be `localhost`
* `DATABASE_PORT` - the port number of the database connection, typically `3306` or `5432`
* `DATABASE_NAME` - the database name (not the schema)
* `DATABASE_USER` - the user account for the database connection
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD` - the user credentials for the database connection
* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - the location of the Google Firebase service account key file
